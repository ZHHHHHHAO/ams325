% This code is a MATLAB implementation for simulating the temperature distribution on a plate using the finite difference method. Here's an explanation of the files, functions, and how to run the code:
% InitializePlate function (initializePlate.m): This function initializes the plate with specified boundary conditions. The plate is represented as a 2D matrix, and the boundary temperatures are set accordingly (top: 100°C, bottom: 50°C, left: 0°C, right: 75°C, and corner temperatures are averages of adjacent boundaries). The initial temperature is set to 25°C for the entire plate.
% UpdateTemperature function (updateTemperature.m): This function updates the temperature distribution on the plate based on the average temperature of the four closest neighboring points. It iterates over the internal points of the plate (excluding the boundaries) and calculates the new temperature for each point.
% AnalyzePlate function (analyzePlate.m): This function analyzes the temperature distribution between the initial and final states of the plate. It computes the average temperature and identifies the point with the maximum temperature change.
% Main Script (TemperatureSimulation.m): This script initializes the plate, iteratively updates the temperature distribution until the change falls below a threshold, and records the temperature distribution at each iteration to create an animation. It also saves two images: the initial temperature distribution and the temperature distribution along the diagonal.
% Simply execute the TemperatureSimulation.m script. It will generate an animation of the temperature evolution, as well as two saved images showing the initial and diagonal temperature distributions.
